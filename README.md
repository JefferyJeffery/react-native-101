#JSConfUY 2016 - Workshop

#React Native 101

This workshop will give an overview of how React Native works, show best practices and build together an iOS and Android App.

##Requirements

Please follow the guide according to your platform:

**iOS Setup** - https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

**Android Setup** - https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html


##Step 1 - Git & NPM
Now that react-native is installed, we need to clone the repo:

* `git clone https://github.com/lucho99/react-native-101`
* `cd react-native-101`

With the repo cloned, we need to install nodejs dependencies:


```
npm install
```

***Note***: Be sure to have the proper node version set in NVM

At this point we should be able to run the app and see the welcome screen, in orded to do that:

In a new terminal window run:

```
npm start
```

Then in a separate terminal window:

```
react-native run-{platform}
```

***Note:*** if running android platform be sure to have the emulator running or the device connected
